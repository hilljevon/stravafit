# Strava Fitness Application

## Overview
The Strava Fitness Application is a data-driven fitness tracker that seamlessly integrates data from the Apple Watch and Strava API, allowing users to automatically sync and visualize their workout data. This application provides detailed insights into users' fitness activities and offers real-time analytics to help users track their progress and stay motivated.

## Features
- **Secure Authentication:** User login through Strava integration, managed by NextAuth, securely retrieves workout data for the past month.
- **Comprehensive Analytics:** Offers in-depth workout statistics, including:
  - **Average Heart Rate:** Monitors heart rate trends over the past month.
  - **Total Running Distance and Mileage:** Tracks cumulative running distance and individual miles.
  - **Categorized Workouts:** Differentiates activities such as lifting, running, and stairmaster exercises.
- **Data Visualization:** Engaging and interactive charts built with ReCharts provide insights on:
  - **Calories Burned** (benchmarked against national averages)
  - **Heart Rate Patterns**
  - **Workout Type Breakdown**

## Note
Due to limited access to the Strava API, only I am currently able to log in and view the complete dashboard. As a result, Iâ€™ve configured the API calls to be local, so users can explore a static version of the application post-authentication. This setup serves as a test site using dummy data.

To see dynamic data, you can clone the repository, create a Strava application via their [developer dashboard](https://developers.strava.com/), and set up the required environment variables. Uncomment the `useEffect` API call in the main client component to fetch relevant athlete data for your account.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** Next.js, TypeScript
- **Backend Integration:** Strava API, NextAuth for authentication
- **Data Visualization:** ReCharts
